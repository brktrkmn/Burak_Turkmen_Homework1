	<h1>Homework for Week 4</h1>
	<h2>HI! My name is Burak. I came from Turkey one month ago. I like photography and playing drums. Back in Turkey, I used to play in a Led Zeppelin cover band and we kicked ass! I also played with other bands but it was just for money. I'd like to add that I am actually a lawyer. After practicing law for 13 years, I had finally enough and wanted to continue doing something I'm interested in and earning my living along the way. Aaand here I am in Canada! Oh by the way, I'm a proud satanist and I appreciate Canada for letting me practice my religion to the fullest..</h2>
